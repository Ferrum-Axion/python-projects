TASK_ID = repo-monitor


Continue working in the same file: `monitor.py`.

## Work
(api reference)  - https://app.sendgrid.com/guide/integrate/langs/python

1. Import SendGrid classes.

   Add imports:

   import os  
   from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient  
   from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail  

2. Create a function responsible for sending email.

   The function should receive:

   - subject
   - body

3. Inside the function, read the API key from environment variable.

   Use the same environment variable created in the previous step.

4. Create an email message object.

   The message should include:

   - sender email (your verified sender)
   - recipient email
   - subject
   - email content

5. Create SendGrid client.

   The client uses the API key to authenticate with SendGrid.

6. Send the email using the SendGrid client.

7. Call the function when all expected branches exist.

   The email should be sent only when all students submitted.
